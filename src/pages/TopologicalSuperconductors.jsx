        Who would have thought that in 1937, an Italian physicist, Ettore
        Majorana, would theoretically propose a new kind of particle, the
        Majorana fermion? Majorana theorized that spin -½ particles could be
        their own antiparticles. His mysterious disappearance left behind both a
        legend and a scientific puzzle.

        This idea led to the discovery of a new state of matter — topological
        superconductors. Superconductors, when cooled to extremely low
        temperatures (around -270°C), can transfer energy with zero resistance.
        These are already used in MRI machines, maglev trains, and particle
        accelerators. But where does topology enter the picture?
      </p>

      <p>
        Topology, in simple terms, is the study of shapes and properties that
        remain unchanged under deformation. In physics, this means certain
        quantum properties remain protected from noise, impurities, or damage.
        Topological superconductors combine this property with superconductivity
        — allowing electrons to flow along edges without disturbance.

        This makes them ideal for next-gen memory storage, low-energy
        electronics, and spintronics. At their core lie the Majorana fermions —
        the building blocks for topological quantum computers that are far more
        stable than current systems. Majorana-based qubits are less prone to
        noise and environmental interference, paving the way for fault-tolerant
        quantum computing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many leading companies like Microsoft (Station Q), Google, and IBM are
        heavily investing in this field. Although experimental topological
        quantum chips have been built in labs worldwide, unambiguous evidence of
        Majorana fermions and large-scale practical implementation remain key
        challenges for the future.
